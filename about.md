Pratyush is a high school graduate, and a late bloomer immensely interested in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) and [Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design). Fields like [Biomimetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics) and [Human Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement) also fascinate me.

I love the idea of thinking about something new and whipping it into existence. 
Therefore, I want to understand the basics of everything and be able to figure out how **Everything Connects**.
